## 11. New Folder (`new/`)
- New files havent category yet

## Moving Instructions
1. Create the above folders in your Java project root
2. Move each file to its designated category folder
3. Test compilation in each folder after moving
4. Keep original files until testing is complete

## Notes
- Some files may serve multiple purposes; they're categorized by their primary function
- The categorization prioritizes the main programming concept demonstrated in each file
- Consider running `javac *.java` in each folder after moving files to verify compilation
- Backup original files before moving them

## Original Locations (for reference)
- Root folder: General files
- `week1/`, `week4/`, `week5/`: Time-based organization (old)
- `minggu4/`: Weekly exercises (old)

This mapping can be adjusted based on your preferences or specific needs. Feel free to modify the categories or move files differently if you have a different organizational preference.
